<h2> Taking photos with tigers</h2>
<h3> Do you know what a tiger went through just for you to take a photo with them?</h3>
<p> Tigers are taken from their mothers at only a few weeks old, and bred in industrial tiger farms. They have to go through strict and cruel training and adult tigers have to be chained inorder to be taken photos with. When they aren't being taken photos of, they are led back into their cages in which they are packed together without enough room.</p>
